% PatchWarp application to registration between different imaging sessions
% -------------------
% Note that this across-session registration function is standalone. You do
% not need to process your imaging data using the main PatchWarp pipeline
% to use this across-session registration function. You only need 2D images
% such as the mean image or the max-projection image for each imaging session.

%% Specifiy paths of the summary images from 2 different sessions
% Summary images can be either the mean image of all frames (e.g. downsampled_50_warped_mean.tif) or 
% the max-projection of downsampled movie (e.g. downsampled_50_warped_mean.tif) from the outputs of PatchWarp pipeline.
% They do not need to be from the main PatchWarp pipeline if you used a different motion correction software.
% The results are more robust and accurate if both mean and max-projection images are used.

%% Prepare inputs for PatchWarp
% Users can use any kinds of 2D summary images. Here, we are using a mean
% image and a max-projection image. You can use either only one of them, or
% use both by concatenating the images along the 3rd dimension. If you use
% both of them, the PatchWarp results are more robust and accurate. Users can
% add more summary images along the 3rd dimension if users need more robust 
% results(e.g. standard deviation map, correlation map).

%% Apply PatchWarp to register images from session#2 to images from session#1
% transform1:                           Transformation type for the 1st transformation that uses the whole FOV. Typically 'euclidean' should work best. 
%                                       If 'euclidean' does not work, try 'affine'. This 1st transformation matrix is obtained by the pyramid method with 3 levels.
% transform2:                           Transformation type for the 2nd transformations for each subfield. Typically 'affine' should work best. 
%                                       These 2nd transformation matrices are obtained without pyramids.
% warp_blocksize:                       Row and column numbers for splitting FOV. Each image is split into [warp_blocksize]*[warp_blocksize] subfields 
%                                       for estimating and applying affine transformation matrices.
% warp_overlap_pix_frac:                Fraction of edge pixels that overlaps with the adjacent patches. [warp_overlap_pix_frac]*[length of a patch] pixels 
%                                       at the edge of each patch will be shared with the adjacent patch.
%                                       with its adjacent subfields.
% norm_radius:                          If this is > 0, the intensity of each pixel is normalized with the mean intensity within the specified radius. 
%                                       Disable this normalization by setting this to 0. Usually works better without this normalization.
